% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[10pt, conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsocconf option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  \usepackage{textcomp}
  \usepackage{listings}
  \lstset{upquote=true}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
API documentation presents both a problem and an opportunity for API usability. Representational State Transfer, or more commonly known as REST based APIs are used by software developers to interconnect applications over HTTP. Developers are required to publish and maintain the documentation of their REST APIs so that other developers can learn and use the APIs as intended. This poses the problem of identifying an efficient and effective process of generating and maintaining the documentation of REST APIs. In this paper, we have discussed our lessons learned from a case study comprising of the production use of an automated example oriented REST API documentation approach using a tool called SpyREST at Cisco over a period of eighteen months. We have observed that continuously updated documentation can be achieved by using automated test code against a REST API. Practitioners can leverage the insights shared in this paper to improve the state of their REST API documentation process. Researchers and tool developers can incorporate the ideas from this case study to extend the example oriented documentation approach to APIs beyond the realm of REST APIs.

\section{Introduction}
Application Programming Interfaces, commonly known as APIs, are used to express a software component in terms of its operations, inputs, outputs, and their types\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface}}. Robillard describes API as follows: An API is the interface to implement functionality that developers can access to perform various tasks \cite{Robillard_a_field_study} \cite{Robillard_what_makes}.


REST APIs are a subclass of APIs that use standard web technologies for interconnectivity over HTTP. Fielding defined Representational State Transfer or REST as an architectural style for developing distributed hypermedia systems \cite{Fielding_rest}. REST APIs provide an abstraction of the underlying system by using system specific resources such as documents, images, etc. and unique identifiers to access the resources. Using REST APIs, systems perform actions on the resources by transferring a representation of the resources between various systems. For example, the GitHub REST API\footnote{\url{https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create}} has a resource called $Repository$ to denote a code repository hosted on GitHub.

Researchers identified the documentation of APIs as both the primary source of information as well as the key obstacle for API usability \cite{Robillard_what_makes}. To this regard, researchers have identified the qualities of ``good API documentation'' as follows: complete, correct, includes thorough explanations and code examples, provides consistent presentation and organization \cite{Robillard_what_makes,Myers_study}. In our previous work, we introduced a novel technique and SpyREST, an implementation, based on an HTTP proxy server to automatically intercept example REST API calls and synthesize the data to produce REST API documentation to meet the aforementioned qualities.

The case study in this paper presents an evaluation of SpyREST in the industry. SpyREST is being used in production at Cisco for the documentation of a commercial REST API of a cloud based Cyber security product that the first author of this paper is affiliated with. It provides us with a unique opportunity to analyze the impact of the industry adoption of a tool developed in research. Production usage over an eighteen month period also allows us to understand the problem and opportunities presented by SpyREST in depth. Despite the popularity and adoption of REST APIs, there is a lack of published work about the API documentation techniques used by today's internet companies. Our core contributions from this case study are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Test driven REST API documentation}. For practitioners, we discuss a reusable technique for producing example oriented REST API documentation as a byproduct from automated API test code.
  \item \textbf{Evolution of API documentation}. For practitioners, we discuss a viable technique for maintaining the evolution of API documentation as the API evolves without duplicating effort.
  \item \textbf{Implications for future work}. We show a practical evidence that API documentation can be generated by intercepting and transforming example API calls. Researchers can leverage this technique to improve tool support for the documentation of other forms of APIs beyond REST.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in the following section we present a literature review to discuss the current state of research on REST API documentation. Then, we provide a brief overview of our REST API documentation technique and the tool, SpyREST, followed by a case study of using SpyREST at Cisco. Then, we discuss our lessons learned and the limitations of this case study.


\section{Related Work}

\subsection{API Usability and Documentation} % (fold)

API usability is a qualitative concept derived from the characteristics that make an API easy to use. Several papers in the existing literature have focused on identifying the characteristics that make an API usable based on case studies. Robillard studied API usability by surveying 83 software developers at Microsoft \cite{Robillard_a_field_study}. Robillard found that 78\% of the survey participants read API documentation to learn the APIs, 55\% used code examples, 34\% experimented with the APIs, 30\% read articles, and 29\% asked colleagues. While API documentation is used as the principal source of information about how to use an API, Robillard et al. found that the most severe API learning obstacles are related to the API documentation. For API usability, Robillard suggested the following requirements as must-have for API documentation: include good examples, be complete, support many example usage scenarios, be conveniently organized, and include relevant design elements. Zibran et al. analyzed bug repositories  for 562 API usability related bugs from five different projects and found that 27.3\% of the reported bugs are API documentation bugs \cite{zibran2011useful}. Scheller et al. provided a framework for objectively measuring API usability based on the number and types of different objects and methods that the API provides \cite{scheller2015automated}.

Kuhn performed a user study with 19 professional software developers to understand requirements for tool development to support API learnability \cite{Kuhn_on_designing}. Kuhn recommended the following as requirements for API documentation: trustworthiness, confidentiality, lack of information overload and the need for code examples as first-class documentation artifacts. Shi et al. observed a large number of API documentation changes related to polishing the custom content, (i.e. fix typos, and API usage examples) \cite{shi2011empirical}. They recommended API documentation tools to support editors for custom content to provide usage tips and simple ways to include API usage examples without syntax errors. Ko et al. found that thorough introductions to the concepts, standards and ideas in API documentation are a prerequisite for developers to be able to effectively use an API  \cite{ko2011role}.

The strong relationship between the documentation and usability of the API as discussed in the aforementioned papers also applies to the context of REST APIs.

\subsection{Usage Examples in API Documentation} % (fold)

% subsection tool_support (end)

Several authors introduced tool support for including usage examples with API documentation. Hoffman et al. recommended using executable examples in API documentation \cite{Hoffman_api_documentation}. They introduced Roast test as tool support  to combine prosaic descriptions of Java APIs along with executable code examples in a unified API documentation. Montandon et al. developed APIMiner as a search tool for Java and Android APIs and recommended providing production-like API usage examples in the API documentation \cite{montandon2013documenting}. They observed that 35\% of API related web searches performed on APIMiner included the term “example” inferring that developers search for source code examples while using API documentation. Zhu et al. developed an Eclipse plugin called UsETeC to extract API usage examples by automatically synthesizing JUnit test code of the APIs \cite{zhu2014mining}. Stylos presented Jadeite as an IDE plug-in that combines a few techniques to provide developers with faster access to relevant API documentation \cite{Jadeite}. Jadeite uses placeholders for API elements such as classes and method names that developers commonly expect to exist, but the actual classes or methods are named differently. When developers search for placeholder API elements, Jadeite shows links to the API documentation of the actual API elements and finds relevant usage examples from Google code search.

Several authors presented techniques for linking official API documentation with crowd-sourced API usage examples that is otherwise fragmented. Nasehi et al. recommended mining knowledge repositories such as StackOverflow and developer forums should be considered for retrieving useful code examples \cite{Nasehi_what_makes}. Parnin et al. found that examples of 87.9\% of all jQuery API methods are found by searching software development blogs and forums \cite{Parnin_measuring}. Wu et al. presented an Eclipse plugin called CoDocent that can automatically find code examples using various online code search engines and link with the relevant official API documentation \cite{wu2010codocent}. Chen et al. presented a technique to automatically link official documentation with crowd-sourced documentation by recording the API related web searches that are performed by developers \cite{Chen_who_asked}. Dagenais et al. presented a technique and a tool called RecoDoc to link code-like elements from API mailing lists and developer forums with their corresponding code elements in the API documentation \cite{dagenais2012recovering}. Treude et al. presented a machine learned based technique called SISE to augment useful information from StackOverflow to API documentation by using text similarity of API elements and StackOverflow content \cite{Treude:2016:AAD:2884781.2884800}.

As mentioned above, we observed that the research on API documentation related tools have focused on local APIs such as Java library APIs. We found a lack of published work on the tool support for including usage examples with REST API documentation.s

\subsection{REST API Documentation} % (fold)
Maleshkova analyzed the state of RESTful APIs and found that most RESTful APIs are manually documented which results in API underspecification, and a lack of support for common tasks and reusable tools \cite{Maleshkova_investigating}. Myers et al. performed a user study on the usability of a complex API for enterprise SOA \cite{Myers_study}. They recommended providing a consistent look-and-feel with explanation for the starting points and an overall map comprising of both text and diagrams, providing a browsing experience with breadcrumb trail following a hierarchy, an effective search interface, providing example code and a way to exercise the examples online without writing code. In a case study, we found the documentation of RESTful APIs are performed manually or using bespoke tools \cite{sohan2015case}. We observed the documentation of the studied RESTful APIs to commonly include summary information and API examples, with optional description of the structure of API requests and responses.

Several authors have suggested machine readable specification languages for REST APIs that can be used to transform into API documentation and auto generated API client code. Hadley proposed WADL (Web Application Description Language) \cite{hadley2006web}. Mangler et al. proposed RIDDL as an extension of WADL to support composition and evolution of REST APIs \cite{mangler2010origin}. Kopecky et al. proposed hRESTS, as an HTML based mico-format to describe RESTful APIs \cite{Kopecky_hrests}. Verborgh et al. proposed RESTdesc as a language to define RESTful APIs using resources and links that connects the resources \cite{RESTdesc}. Danielsen presented a vocabulary to describe RESTful APIs using WIfL(Web Interface Language) \cite{Danielsen_validation}. Lei et al. presented OmniVoke as a tool to abstract out multiple RESTful APIs under a unified interface following a specification \cite{Ning_omnivoke}. Polak proposed a specification format for REST API using the Model-Driven Architectural principle where the evolution of a REST API can be programmatically managed from it's model representation \cite{Polak:2015:RAM:2790798.2790820}.

In addition to the existing literature, several REST API description languages have been proposed by industry practitioners such as RAML\footnote{\url{http://raml.org/}}, Blueprint\footnote{\url{https://apiblueprint.org/}}, and Swagger\footnote{\url{http://swagger.io/}}. There are tools that can automatically convert and publish the description of RESTful APIs from these languages into HTML based RESTful API documentation.

The primary advantage of these specification languages is code generation and automatic transformation into REST API documentation. On the other hand, we found a lack of automated tool support for producing the API specifications for REST APIs.

Table \ref{table:restful_apis} contrasts the current state of tool support for REST API documentation against a set of properties that researchers identified as required for API usability. In summary, practitioners and researchers have attempted to solve the problem of RESTful API documentation by proposing candidate specifications to standardize the vocabulary and format of describing RESTful APIs. Manual work is needed by REST API developers to generate and maintain their API specifications as it evolves. These specification formats support describing the structure of different API elements (the syntax), but no support is provided for API usage examples and executable API examples (the semantics), an important attribute for API learnability as identified by the researchers. Also, we found a lack of published papers on the effectiveness of the aforementioned specification languages in an industry setting. In our work with SpyREST, instead of relying on specification, we have focused on automatically intercepting and transforming example REST API calls into usable documentation. In this paper we have shared the lessons learned of using this new technique at Cisco.

We provide a brief overview of SpyREST, the REST API documentation tool and the underlying technique used in this case study. In our previous papers, we have discussed the design and implementation of this tool in greater detail \cite{DBLP:conf/kbse/SohanAM15, DBLP:conf/kbse/SohanAM15a}.

At the heart of the technique is a pass-through HTTP proxy server which acts as an interceptor between an API client and the API. This allows the proxy server to inspect the raw HTTP request and response data from the example API calls. However, for usable API documentation the raw HTTP data needs to be furthered processed and enriched with meta data. For example, given the following HTTP request and response data from an example API call to create a blog post:
\begin{lstlisting}
  Request Verb: POST
  Request URL: /v2/posts
  Request Headers:
    Content-Type: application/json
    Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==
  Request Body:
    {
      "title":"My New Blog post",
      "content": "This is a new blog post"
    }

  Response Headers:
    Location: "/v2/posts/1"
    host: "blog.example.com"

\end{lstlisting}

A series of transformation needs to take place to produce a usable API documentation. The proxy server used by SpyREST is customized to record and synthesize such example API calls. The transformation process involves the following analyzers:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{API version analyzer}. The version analyzer inspects the URL and a request header named $Accept: $ to automatically infer the API version used by the example API call. From the aforementioned example, the version analyzer auto-detects the API version as v2 based on the URL. It uses regular expressions to match the URL and $Accept$ header against the commonly used API versioning formats.

  \item \textbf{API resource analyzer}. To generate a hierarchical representation of the API elements, it's important to group multiple API actions that correspond to a single API resource under a single hierarchy. API resource analyzer parses the API URL and detects the rightmost non-numeric part of the URL path as the API resource. For the given example, SpyREST detects $post$ as the API resource.

  \item \textbf{API action analyzer}. Each API resource can be accessed or modified via the API actions. The API action analyzer infers the API action from example API calls by combining the HTTP verb (e.g. $GET, POST$) with an auto-templated representation of the path. For the given example, the action analyzer identifies $POST /v2/posts$ as the API action. If the path contains numeric or uuid parameters, the a templated path is used. For example, the API action analyzer detects a $GET$ request to the path $/v2/posts/1/comments/10$ as the API action $GET /v2/posts/:post_id/comments/:comment_id$. The templated API actions offer a more meaningful representation of the intent, and allows multiple API examples to be grouped under a single API action.

  \item \textbf{API query parameter analyzer:}. The query parameter analyzer records each query parameter that is used by the example API calls and automatically infers the data types such as integer, string, timestamp, etc. For each API action, a query parameter table is shown where each row displays the name, auto-detected data type, and example values for each query parameter.

  \item \textbf{API request header analyzer}: The request header analyzer strips the $Authorization$ header to remove confidential credentials from the API documentation. Additionally, the request header analyzer automatically detects the type of authorization used, e.g. Basic, Token, etc. For the given example, the API requests header analyzer transforms the $Authorization$ header's value as $Authorization: Basic FILTERED$.

  \item \textbf{API body analyzer}: The body analyzer captures the request and response bodies and infers the structure of the body as an object with auto-detected field names and data types. The request body analyzers produces the following information from the given example for API documentation:

  \begin{tabular}{|l | l | l|}
    \hline
    Field & Data Type & Example \\
    \hline
    title & String & My New Blog post \\
    \hline
    content & String & This is a new blog post \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}

  \item \textbf{API response header analyzer}: The response header analyzer maintains a list of commonly found response headers (e.g. host, pragma, server, etc.) that add little value to API documentation and automatically removes them from the documentation.

  \item \textbf{Custom content analyzer}: The version, resource, and action analyzers detect commonly seen patterns and extracts the relevant information. The result is also used to automatically infer a human readable description for each API action. For the given example, the auto detected description is as follows: $Create a Post$ by combining the HTTP verb ($POST$) with the API resource ($post$). When unfamiliar formats are used by an API or customization is required, the custom content analyzer allows API developers to override each of the auto-detected attributes such as the API version, resource, action and description by using a set of SpyREST specific request headers (e.g. $x-spy-rest-version, x-spy-rest-resource$, etc.).
\end{itemize}


As shown before, SpyREST uses the aforementioned analyzers to transform the raw HTTP request and response information from example REST API calls into a structured representation of the API as follows: A REST API has one or more versions, each version has one or more API resources, each resource has one of more actions, and each action is defined by its URL, query parameters, request and response headers and bodies, and one or more usage examples.

SpyREST has a web based UI to render a hierarchical representation of the aforementioned structured data as the API documentation. The web UI also features a wiki-like editor on each page so that human written detailed descriptions can be added with rich content to explain business concepts. In addition to displaying the structured API documentation, the web UI also features an executable code using cURL \footnote{\url{https://curl.haxx.se/}}, a commonly used tool for accessing resources over HTTP, for each captured API example so that the API client developers can try the API examples without having to write custom code.

To generate usable API documentation, REST API developers need to run appropriate example API calls via SpyREST proxy server. Once a set of example API calls are defined, the documentation can be auto-updated by replaying the example API calls. The replay only updates the auto-generated part of the documentation leaving the human written descriptions unchanged.

To summarize, SpyREST provides tool support to improve the process of REST API documentation with usage examples, automatic updates, executable examples and a consistent hierarchical representation of the API.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the

% used instead of \subfloat.

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically

% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
